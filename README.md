# lookerstudio_store_sales
This project was developed in BI Google Looker Studio, using the database Kaggle.

It is possible for the user to select the date, shopping mall, category, and age.

I used some types of graphics to explain the aspects of Store Sales:
- Map chart: used to show the sales around de country.
- Gaugh with ranges and sparkline charts: used to show data about sales and profit margin.
- Scatter chart: used to compare the shopping malls from the perspective of sales and profit margin.
- Bar chart: used to compare the categories from the perspective of sales and profit margin.

Dashboard available on:
